Each sample is an automatically generated network using SUMO's OSMWebWizard tool. Each folder contains the files that were automatically generated:

	osm.net.xml - the network file
	output.xml - the scenario output file

The output.xml file is generated by running the scenario, but this output file is not created by default.
Open osm.sumocfg in a text editor, and add the following within the <configuration> </configuration> tags (see the samples' osm.sumocfg files for an example):

    <output> 
        <fcd-output value="output.xml" />
        <fcd-output.geo value="true"/>
    </output>


When editing a network using NETEDIT, the old scenarios that were generated will throw errors due to no-longer-existing edges and junctions. We can generate new scenarios using the modified network.

Add SUMO directory added as a PATH variable/environment variable, or manually navigate to SUMO's installation directory and randomTrips.py in the next step.

Open a terminal window in the specific sample folder you want to generate a scenario for, and run either command below (with the full path to "SUMO directory"/randomTrips.py if you did not add it to your environment variables):


Command used to generate light traffic, for 3000 seconds:

randomTrips.py -n osm.net.xml -e 3000 --period 10 -o osm.passenger.trips.xml --route-file osm.passenger.rou.xml --fringe-factor 10 --validate --trip-attributes="departLane=\"best\" departSpeed=\"max\" departPos=\"random\""


Command used to generate heavy traffic, for 3000 seconds:

randomTrips.py -n osm.net.xml -e 3000 --period 1.7 -o osm.passenger.trips.xml --route-file osm.passenger.rou.xml --fringe-factor 10 --validate --trip-attributes="departLane=\"best\" departSpeed=\"max\" departPos=\"random\""

This will generate a new routes file (.rou.xml) and a new trips file (.trips.xml), both containing only valid trips. Edit the parameters as needed.
